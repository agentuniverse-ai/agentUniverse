# Version Update History
## [0.0.18] - 2025-07-10
### Added
- Added observability capabilities for agent applications based on the OTel protocol
Established observation standards for aU agent applications based on OTel (OpenTelemetry) protocol. Comprehensive metrics and traces (including token consumption, latency, success rate, etc.) are collected across key components such as agents, LLMs, and tools. The implementation supports integration with mainstream observability frameworks including SigNoz, Jaeger, and Prometheus, enabling full lifecycle observability for agents.

## [0.0.14] - 2025-01-26
### Added
- aU Memory Component Version Update   
The new version provides comprehensive memory management and utilization capabilities for multi-agent applications through a global memory module. It can automatically collect, record, and process memory interactions among multiple agents, including conversations, model calls, tool calls, and knowledge retrieval. Additionally, it offers functionalities such as memory addition, memory retrieval, memory modification, memory compression, memory pruning, memory extraction, and multi-source persistence for both single-agent and multi-agent.

- Add AgentTemplate Component and WorkPattern Component    
The AgentTemplate component helps users rapidly create agents according to pre-defined templates, while the WorkPattern component assists agent teams in selecting specific collaboration methods. In versions prior to V0.0.13, the Planner component offered both the customization logic of intelligent agents and their work patterns. The customization logic for agents was often modified due to the task, whereas work patterns were validated and stability. Consequently, users frequently needed to rewrite the Planner and focus on the code logic related to work patterns, which significantly increased their usage and development costs. With the new version, we have layered the customization logic and work patterns in the agent-building process. It will make the research on collaboration modes and the construction of intelligent agents more focused and efficient. The original Planner component will still be retained, but it will no longer be recommended.

- Knowledge Components Update   
Add: Markdown format knowledge loading component, document chapter and paragraph segmentation component, knowledge graph storage component (beta version).

### Changed
- Standard Project Scaffolding Update   
The scaffolding Project Scaffolding has been standardized. You can read the [「Application Project Structure and Explanation」](./docs/guidebook/en/Get_Start/1.Application_Project_Structure_and_Explanation.md)  for more details. For users of older versions, we have provided some guidelines and tools for this update, detailed information can be found in [「aU Old and New Project Migration Guide」](./docs/guidebook/en/Get_Start/6.aU_Old_and_New_Project_Migration_Guide.md).

### Note 
- Update docs for new memory version
- Optimization official docs and examples project
- Ask for high-priority features

### Changed
- Flask is set as the default webserver startup method across all platforms, with gunicorn and gRPC capabilities disabled by default
  - In the previous version, we found slight compatibility differences with gunicorn and gRPC across different operating systems. Thus, we have made Flask the primary startup method for all platforms. You can enable gunicorn and gRPC in the configuration as needed.

### Security
- Some aU dependencies were identified to have security vulnerabilities in third-party packages. For security reasons, we have upgraded their versions, with the main changes including:
  - requests (^2.31.0 -> ^2.32.0)
  - flask (^2.2 -> ^2.3.2)
  - werkzeug (^2.2.2 -> ^3.0.3)
  - langchain (0.0.352 -> 0.1.20)
  - langchain-core (0.1.3 -> 0.1.52)
  - langchain-community (no version lock -> 0.0.38)
  - gunicorn (21.2.0 -> ^22.0.0)
  - Jinja2 (no version lock -> ^3.1.4)
  - tqdm (no version lock -> ^4.66.3)
If your system has external access, we strongly recommend installing version v0.0.8 of agentUniverse to mitigate the security risks posed by these third-party packages. For more detailed information, you can visit https://security.snyk.io.

### Fixed
- Fixed potential concurrency safety issues in the peer planner.
- Fixed the issue in version 0.0.4 of the PyPI package where the packaging method forced users to enter an AK upon startup.

### Note 
- Some code optimizations and documentation updates.

## [0.0.4] - 2024-04-26
### Added
- Add version management capability to the prompt.

### Fixed
- Fixed compatibility issues on Windows
  * Due to compatibility issues of Gunicorn with Windows systems, automatically identify the kernel version to select the web startup method.
  * Specified YAML reading as UTF-8 encoding method.

### Note
- [2024-05-08] Please be aware that the PyPI package version 0.0.4 includes the sample_standard_app example project by default. This will reference additional components from sample_standard_app at startup and require users to input an AK. If you are not using the corresponding components, you can bypass this restriction by using a mock AK. This issue has been fixed in version 0.0.5.
