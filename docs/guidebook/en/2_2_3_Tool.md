# Tool
Just as humans use and create tools to extend their capabilities, enhance their professionalism, and compensate for deficiencies in their innate abilities, intelligent agents can also leverage tools to push the boundaries of their capabilities. 

In complex task scenarios, specialized tools are often needed to improve the performance of agents. These tools can be existing APIs or methods within the task domain or new methods created by users to solve problems.

agentUniverse provides a standardized approach to customizing tools. Combining underlying RPC technological components with standard HTTP protocol, you can register any API or local code snippet as a standard tool for use by agents and other components.

# Conclusion
By now, you should have a basic understanding of the design principles behind tool components. In the next section, we will introduce you to the standard definitions of tool components, how to customize and create your own tools, and how to utilize these tools.
